object is an instatnce of a class
class members
data members like employee id , salary but the company name can be kept static
for static only one memory is allocated but for salary different
 memory will created for different employee
for employee id and salary heap memory will be created again and again


constructoor same as class name withoutt return type, to initialize variables

static method can have access to static variables

attributes is nothing but variables

if there is a final variable then we can only initialize it using a construtor

in java for printing and scaning we use System.out.prinln function and scanner class
System.in.read(){thisonly reads character by character and stores the ascii value}
reads only one character



in overiding static will not get overidden 
static methods cant be overidden

overloading compile time polymorphism // different signature
orveridding run time polymorphism // parent class and subclass wtih same signature

same method is acting differently for different classes

data memebers will not be overidden
