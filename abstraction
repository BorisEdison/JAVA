object of class
will hide details of the user

using abtract class we can only achive partial abstraction

we cannot create abstract object meaning it cannnot instantiated     abstract method dont have a method body
it can have final mehtodit can have contuctor and static method;


keyword abstraction

abstract class {}   //class

abstract class can have non absract mehtod and class

absract void setinfo()    // method            regular or concrete method
cannot have non abstract
dont have immplmentation details




abstract mehtod must be given implementation in the sub class

when sub class object is created default constructor is executed
